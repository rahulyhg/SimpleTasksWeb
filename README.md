# Simple Tasks Web

Visit https://simpletasksweb.000webhostapp.com to see the application in action.

## App Description
SimpleTasksWeb is a port of SimpleTasks for Android for online use. The design has been tried to be as close as possibile
to the native application, following Google's Material Design.

## Why is this useful?
If you have a busy schedule and have many things to do in a day, this simple web application is perfect for you.
This application only uses 100% pure JavaScript and PHP. Because I chose to make this simple and easy, you will be able
to very quickly load this web application on your desktop or mobile browser. If you want even quicker performance,
download the native Android app on the
[Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kyle_stank.simple_tasks)!

## Plans
- Add user authentication
- Fix any bugs that might be present
- Tidy up PHP and JavaScript code a bit
- ~~Deploy to free web server~~
- Completely rewrite mobile app
- Purchase hosting and domain (this is a ways away due to mobile app being incomplete)

#### PHP programmers are encouraged to contribute.
